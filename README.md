# moomoo mama

'Mothers' is plural, just like us! It is possible to have more than 1 mother regardless of plurality.

Tbh, I was always fine with being just mid/meâ€¦ if you'd allow me to choose. People always have to be allowed to choose.  
(the elephant in the room would also like to be acknowledged at some point)

TLDR: just memes, no strings attached
